# shift_weekday

## Message for finalist

Hey Calvin,

you are one of our finalist in this application round.

Contrary to my statement in the interview to finalize our decisions I would like to ask for a small coding challenge:
Please use our public API: `https://public.ordio.com/api/doc (Api Key: 7c46bc75f3781e1c8255)` and get all shifts in the time period of 2023-10-01T00:00:00Z and 2023-10-31T23:59:00Z.
Then as an expected outcome please give us an overview of the weekday percentages an employee (candidate of a shift) is working in this month. (Employee 1: MO: 20%, TU: 13%, WE: 15%...)

You can choose your preferred framework. Let me know if you have any questions!

Kind Regards,
Tim
